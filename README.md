# Claude School Meta-Learning System

A unified system for tracking progress, maintaining session continuity, and compiling personal knowledge during AI-native development learning.

## Purpose

This system helps me:
1. Track progress through the 6-stage agentic engineering roadmap
2. Maintain context between learning sessions
3. Enforce quality gates before advancing
4. Compile knowledge from multiple sources into a personal knowledge base

## Current Status

**Stage:** 1 - Foundation  
**Session:** 2 - Git Workflows & CSMLS Foundation  
**Started:** January 2026
