  "keyInsights": [
    "path.join() is not a security function - it resolves paths but doesn't prevent traversal",
    "Always decode user input (decodeURIComponent) BEFORE validating it - validation on encoded input is security theater",
    "Browsers normalize URLs before sending, hiding path traversal - must test programmatically",
    "First fixes aren't always complete - iterative testing found URL encoding bypass (%2e%2e)",
    "The pre_tool_use.py hook blocked rm commands during the session - proof hooks work in practice",
    "Agent output can be over-engineered - 12 files for 1 bug fix, trimmed to 2 useful ones"
